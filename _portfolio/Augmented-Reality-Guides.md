User guides and do it yourself step by step instructions are an extremely valuable resource to those interested in repairing things without going to a business. Currently, sites such as Chiltondiy provide a method for hobbyists to access manuals, documentation, and step by step guides, but only provide one size fits all guidance.

I worked with a small team to create an application using Apple's ARKit library to create an app that could function as a better replacement for repair manuals, and allow users to attempt technical tasks with confidence. We created an application that supports any number of step-by-step walkthroughs which work by using an Ipnone's camera feed and augemneting the video with hightlights, arrows, and text to instruct users on what they should do next.

<h3>During the project, the portions I was responsible for were the following:</h3>

* Intial exploration - I worked with other team members to investigate various software and approaches to determine which would be best suited for our guide applicaiton, and through our combined efforts we deicded that the ARKit library worked well. 
* Creating a method to import new guides from JSON files. I worked to outline a format that would be easy to use, with all properties of each step grouped together, and ensured the application was able to utilize JSON files to create the steps for a guide. 
* Code standards - I was responsible for review code and making chanes to ensure all code fit our required standards: commented, having a header, and following porper code conventions. 
* Augmented arrows - I worked to create a system that could apply a variety of arrows based on simple input, such as 'up' or 'down', and would automatically apply the correct arrow to the video feed.
