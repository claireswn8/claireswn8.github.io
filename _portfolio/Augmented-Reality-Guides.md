User guides and do it yourself step by step instructions are an extremely valuable resource to those interested in repairing things without going to a business. Currently, sites such as Chiltondiy provide a method for hobbyists to access manuals, documentation, and step by step guides, but only provide one size fits all guidance.

I worked with a small team to create an application using Apple's ARKit library to create an app that could function as a better replacement for repair manuals, and allow users to attempt technical tasks with confidence. We created an application that supports any number of step-by-step walkthroughs which work by using an Ipnone's camera feed and augemneting the video with hightlights, arrows, and text to instruct users on what they should do next.
